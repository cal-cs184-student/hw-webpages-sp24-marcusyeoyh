<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
<h3>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?</h3>
<p>
  A lower KS means a smaller spring constant, making the cloth seem less 'taut' and looser as there is a smaller spring force acting in the opposite direction to external forces. On the other hand, a higher KS value means that the cloth looks more stiff.
</p>
<p>
  This is observed in motion, where a cloth with a small KS value has many ripples visible as it falls, looking much more fluid and loose as compare to the cloth with a high ks value, which seems much stiffer in motion.
</p>
<p>
  At rest, we can observe that the cloth with a small ks value seems to 'sag', with a seemingly lower end point and has much fewer creases than that of a cloth with a larger KS value. In comparison, the cloth with a high KS value has much more obvious creases in the cloth at its end position and is less deformed as compared to the cloth with a low ks value. There are also much more obvious ripples that propagate through the cloth when it comes to its final resting position when ks is larger.
</p>
<h3>What about for density?</h3>
<p>
  During motion, a cloth with a higher density is observed to have more ripples when density is higher as compared to when density is lower
</p>
<p>
  At rest, the differences are more pronounced, where a higher density causes the cloth to 'sag' more, with more creases and a greater concave arch at the top and edges which flare up at the bottom, giving the impression that the cloth is 'heavier'. On the other hand, the less dense cloth has fewer deformations and has fewer creases, giving the impression that it is 'lighter'
</p>
<h3>What about for damping?</h3>
<p>
  In motion, the cloth with higher % dampening is observed to fall slower, but reach its resting position much faster than one with less % dampening. This is because the cloth with less dampening oscillates back and forth quickly and creases, taking more time to come to rest. This is to be expected as a higher dampening % decreases the displacement of each point mass in the cloth, reducing motion of the cloth at a greater rate.
</p>
<h3>For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.</h3>

</div>
<p>
  Discussed earlier, we can observe how a higher spring constant ks seems stiffer and sags less, leads to less deformation of the cloth. We can observe how a higher density value does the opposite and deforms the cloth more, with more and larger creases observed, leading to the impression that the cloth is 'heaver'. We can also see how a low dampening value cloth oscillates multiple times before coming to rest, which takes more time than a cloth with a high dampening value.

<h3>Describe the differences in the results.</h3>
<p>
  As described earlier, a smaller ks value means that the cloth appears looser due to the smaller spring constant resulting in smaller spring forces acting between the point masses due to external forces. On the other hand, a larger ks value means stronger spring forces between point masses, which keeps them close together and gives a stiffer look.
</p>
<p>
  This can be observed in the final resting states, where a smaller ks value gives a better drape over the sphere and bends to conform to the shape of the sphere. This is in contrast to a cloth with high ks value, which looks much more rigid and barely conforms to the shape of the sphere.
</p>

<h3>
  Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.
</h3>

<div align="center">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="media/Part4/low_density.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Low Density (5 g/cm^2)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>High Density (5000 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  When density is low, we can observe that there are large folds throughout the cloth as it falls. This is in stark contrast to the cloth with high density, where most of the folds are concentrated to the bottom of the cloth and smaller, less obvious creases are seen throughout the upper part of the cloth.
</p>
<p>
  At rest, the cloth with smaller density has fewer folds and seems to have more flat areas. On the other hand, the cloth with higher density is more crumpled and creased when lying on the plane.

<p>
  In motion, the cloth with a smaller ks value has more creases as compared to a cloth with a higher ks value. At rest, the cloth with smaller ks value seems more crumpled and compressed, while the cloth with a higher ks value has fewer creases with more flat areas.
</p>
<p>This is consistent with the fact that a higher ks value means a greater spring constant and hence less deformation in the cloth as it falls onto itself.</p>
